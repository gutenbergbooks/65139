                                 HISTORY

The OSTRICH leaves its eggs in the desert, and if it goes far away,
it cannot find them again. In the Bible, cruel and forgetful people
are compared to the Ostrich. It is a large bird, and runs very swiftly
when pursued, and if it finds a bush it hides its head, and thinks that
because it does not see its pursuers, they cannot see it. The Ostrich may
remind us of ourselves, as we are by nature inclined to be unkind and
forgetful, and to act as if we thought God did not see us.


[Illustration]

The EAGLE is a bird of prey; it is violent and strong, yet we read that
it obeys the command of God, (Job xxxix. 27.) and that he uses it to
punish those who disobey him. (Prov. xxx. 17.) Thus God often makes use
of wicked people, to punish others who despise his word. The text in
Proverbs, mentioned above, teaches us that God will punish those who are
disobedient to their parents: I hope my little readers will remember
this.


[Illustration]

The PEACOCK is very vain, and proud of its fine feathers. I suppose that
little girl is proud of her finery, and the little boy tells her she is
like the Peacock. In the book of Job, we are reminded that it was God
who gave the Peacock its beautiful feathers, (c. xxxix. v. 13.) Children
should remember that they have nothing of their own to be proud of,
that every thing they possess is given them by God, and they should be
thankful to him for all his mercies.


[Illustration]

The GOOSE is generally thought a silly bird, but I am sure that little
boy and girl who are so mischievous as to frighten the geese, are much
more silly. Any person who observes geese closely, will find that they
shew many proofs of being wiser than they are supposed to be; so you will
often find among your little companions, that those who appear to be
dull, are superior in many things to others who seem to be very sharp and
clever.


[Illustration]

The SWALLOW is a bird of passage. It is part of the year in one country,
and the other part in another country. In the Bible, we read that the
Swallow observes the time of its coming, but man knows not the judgment
of the Lord. The Swallows go from one country to another exactly at the
time which God has appointed as best for them, but although we are told
in the Bible what is the will of God, and find that nothing else can make
us happy, yet we continually forget it, and so fall into sin, and meet
with many troubles.


[Illustration]

The QUAIL is a small bird, and very pleasant to eat. The Israelites
were tired of the manna which God sent them for food, and desired flesh
without remembering that he knew what was best for them. But though their
request was granted, we read that the wrath of the Lord was kindled
against them, and he smote them with a great plague, so that many died.
When you pray for what you desire to have, always remember that God knows
what is better for you than you do yourself, and intreat him not to give
it, unless it is right for you to have it.


[Illustration]

The PARROT is a chattering bird; it can say many words, but cannot at all
understand the meaning of what it says. I have often seen Parrots without
feathers that talked a great deal of nonsense, I dare say you know that I
mean little boys and girls. We read that “in all labor there is profit,
but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury.” People that talk a
great deal are not wise. In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin.


[Illustration]

The STORK is called in the Bible, by a name which also means pity or
mercy. It is supposed to be so called, because it is said never to
forsake its parents, but to feed them and take care of them as long as
they live. I hope you will not forget this. The fifth commandment is
this, “Honour thy father and mother that it may be well with thee, and
thou mayest live long on the earth.” Undutiful children are not happy
when they grow up.


[Illustration]

The SPARROW is of less value than most other birds, yet we are told that
God takes care even of them. (Matt. x. 29.) This should lead us to say,
if he takes care of the Sparrows, surely he will not overlook children;
and we should pray to God to direct us and to watch over us, and that he
would enable us to love him for his goodness towards us. But above all,
we should praise him for the greatness of his mercy in sending his only
and well-beloved son to die for us, that we might be brought nigh to him.


[Illustration]

The DOVE is said to signify to us what Christ is—meek, lowly, and kind,
bringing us the good tidings of salvation, as the Dove brought to Noah
a proof that the waters were gone from off the face of the earth. Also,
when he causes his people to love him, they are made kind, gentle, and
harmless, and partakers of his Holy Spirit. Let us remember this, and
pray that we may love him, and have our hearts changed, so that we may
delight in doing his will, and be “harmless as doves.”


[Illustration]

The HEN watches over her chickens, and takes care of them; she gathers
them under her wings, and guards them from the hawk, or any other danger.
When Jesus was upon earth, he said, “O Jerusalem, how often would I have
gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens
under her wings, and ye would not.” Jesus is now in heaven, but he
invites us to call upon him by prayer. “The Lord is nigh unto all them
that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.” Ps. cxlv. 18.


[Illustration]

The CHICKENS run to the Hen when they are in danger or distress. My dear
children, do you desire to go to the Saviour and to love him. You are
in a world where danger threatens both your bodies and your souls, but
he has said he will fulfil the desire of them that fear him; he also
will hear their cry, and will save them. (Ps. cxlv. 19.) Do not refuse
to listen to him, for “How shall you escape if you neglect so great
salvation?”


[Illustration]

The RAVEN was the first bird sent out of the ark by Noah, and though the
waters still covered the earth, it did not return again, but continued to
fly about, while the Dove returned to the ark, because she found no rest
for the sole of her foot. When children are grown up, and are tempted by
the pleasures of the world, some, like the Raven, continue to go from one
vanity to another, though they cannot find real happiness in any; while
others fly to the Saviour as the only rest and comfort. My dear child,
are you like the Raven or like the Dove?


[Illustration]

The SWAN appears very beautiful when in the water, but is very awkward
when on the land. The Swan is said to sing when it is dying, perhaps
this is not true, but many dear little children, whom Christ has taken
to himself when young, have been singing his praises when they died. You
may read about some of them in that pretty book “Janeway’s Token for
Children.”

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
