<img src="images/1-ostrich.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="Two ostriches, in desert surroundings" />
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ostrich</span> leaves its eggs in the
desert, and if it goes far away, it cannot
find them again. In the Bible,
cruel and forgetful people are compared
to the Ostrich. It is a large
bird, and runs very swiftly when pursued,
and if it finds a bush it hides its
head, and thinks that because it does
not see its pursuers, they cannot see
it. The Ostrich may remind us of ourselves,
as we are by nature inclined to
be unkind and forgetful, and to act as
if we thought God did not see us.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/2-eagle.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="An eagle feeding on the carcass of a sheep" />
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Eagle</span> is a bird of prey; it is
violent and strong, yet we read that it
obeys the command of God, (Job
xxxix. 27.) and that he uses it to punish
those who disobey him. (Prov. xxx.
17.) Thus God often makes use
of wicked people, to punish others
who despise his word. The text in
Proverbs, mentioned above, teaches us
that God will punish those who are
disobedient to their parents: I hope
my little readers will remember this.</p>

<img src="images/3-peacock.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="A peacock, a girl in finery, and a boy" />
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Peacock</span> is very vain, and proud
of its fine feathers. I suppose that
little girl is proud of her finery, and
the little boy tells her she is like the
Peacock. In the book of Job, we are
reminded that it was God who gave
the Peacock its beautiful feathers,
(c. xxxix. v. 13.) Children should remember
that they have nothing of their
own to be proud of, that every thing
they possess is given them by God, and
they should be thankful to him for all
his mercies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/4-goose.jpg" width="500" height="400" alt="A flock of horrible geese" />
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Goose</span> is generally thought a
silly bird, but I am sure that little boy
and girl who are so mischievous as to
frighten the geese, are much more silly.
Any person who observes geese closely,
will find that they shew many
proofs of being wiser than they are
supposed to be; so you will often find
among your little companions, that
those who appear to be dull, are superior
in many things to others who
seem to be very sharp and clever.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/5-swallow.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="A swallow carrying a piece of paper" />
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Swallow</span> is a bird of passage.
It is part of the year in one country,
and the other part in another country.
In the Bible, we read that the Swallow
observes the time of its coming,
but man knows not the judgment of
the Lord. The Swallows go from one
country to another exactly at the time
which God has appointed as best for
them, but although we are told in the
Bible what is the will of God, and find
that nothing else can make us happy,
yet we continually forget it, and so
fall into sin, and meet with many troubles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/6-quail.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="People looking up at a flock of quail in flight" />
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Quail</span> is a small bird, and very
pleasant to eat. The Israelites were
tired of the manna which God sent
them for food, and desired flesh without
remembering that he knew what
was best for them. But though their
request was granted, we read that the
wrath of the Lord was kindled against
them, and he smote them with a great
plague, so that many died. When you
pray for what you desire to have, always
remember that God knows what
is better for you than you do yourself,
and intreat him not to give it, unless
it is right for you to have it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/7-parrot.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="A caged parrot" />
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Parrot</span> is a chattering bird; it
can say many words, but cannot at all
understand the meaning of what it
says. I have often seen Parrots without
feathers that talked a great deal of
nonsense, I dare say you know that I
mean little boys and girls. We read
that “in all labor there is profit, but
the talk of the lips tendeth only to
penury.” People that talk a great
deal are not wise. In the multitude
of words there wanteth not sin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/8-stork.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="A stork on the opposite bank of a river from some pyramids" />
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Stork</span> is called in the Bible,
by a name which also means pity or
mercy. It is supposed to be so called,
because it is said never to forsake its
parents, but to feed them and take
care of them as long as they live. I
hope you will not forget this. The
fifth commandment is this, “Honour
thy father and mother that it may be
well with thee, and thou mayest live
long on the earth.” Undutiful children
are not happy when they grow
up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/9-sparrow.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="A person watches sparrows in flight" />
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Sparrow</span> is of less value than
most other birds, yet we are told that
God takes care even of them. (Matt.
x. 29.) This should lead us to say, if
he takes care of the Sparrows, surely
he will not overlook children; and we
should pray to God to direct us and
to watch over us, and that he would
enable us to love him for his goodness
towards us. But above all, we should
praise him for the greatness of his
mercy in sending his only and well-beloved
son to die for us, that we
might be brought nigh to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/10-dove.jpg" width="500" height="425" alt="A woman feeding doves outside a cottage" />
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Dove</span> is said to signify to us
what Christ is—meek, lowly, and kind,
bringing us the good tidings of salvation,
as the Dove brought to Noah a
proof that the waters were gone from
off the face of the earth. Also, when
he causes his people to love him, they
are made kind, gentle, and harmless,
and partakers of his Holy Spirit. Let
us remember this, and pray that we
may love him, and have our hearts
changed, so that we may delight in
doing his will, and be “harmless as
doves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/11-hen.jpg" width="500" height="325" alt="A hen and her brood of chickens" />
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Hen</span> watches over her chickens,
and takes care of them; she gathers
them under her wings, and guards them
from the hawk, or any other danger.
When Jesus was upon earth, he said,
“O Jerusalem, how often would I
have gathered thy children together,
even as a hen gathereth her chickens
under her wings, and ye would not.”
Jesus is now in heaven, but he invites
us to call upon him by prayer. “The
Lord is nigh unto all them that call
upon him, to all that call upon him
in truth.” Ps. cxlv. 18.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/12-chickens.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="A woman and child feed chickens in their run" />
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chickens</span> run to the Hen when
they are in danger or distress. My
dear children, do you desire to go to
the Saviour and to love him. You are
in a world where danger threatens
both your bodies and your souls, but
he has said he will fulfil the desire of
them that fear him; he also will hear
their cry, and will save them. (Ps.
cxlv. 19.) Do not refuse to listen to
him, for “How shall you escape if
you neglect so great salvation?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/13-raven.jpg" width="500" height="325" alt="A raven and a dove" />
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Raven</span> was the first bird sent
out of the ark by Noah, and though
the waters still covered the earth, it
did not return again, but continued to
fly about, while the Dove returned to
the ark, because she found no rest for
the sole of her foot. When children
are grown up, and are tempted by the
pleasures of the world, some, like
the Raven, continue to go from one
vanity to another, though they cannot
find real happiness in any; while
others fly to the Saviour as the only
rest and comfort. My dear child, are
you like the Raven or like the Dove?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/14-swan.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="Two swans in water" />
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Swan</span> appears very beautiful
when in the water, but is very awkward
when on the land. The Swan is
said to sing when it is dying, perhaps
this is not true, but many dear little
children, whom Christ has taken to
himself when young, have been singing
his praises when they died. You
may read about some of them in that
pretty book “Janeway’s Token for
Children.”</p>
